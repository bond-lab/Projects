## ToDo

JPC1/JSP3 What do the students know?
 * how are they assessed and by whom?
 * how many hours should they spend per week and overall? 27 hours per credit
 * do projects carry over from earlier semesters?
 * are these semester or year classes?
 
## JPC1 Project activities 1 (5 CRED - 135 h) 2h/week Sem 2nd year students (mainly the same)

Guided research.

## JSP3 Semester project 3 (6 Cred - 162 h)  2h/week 2nd year students

Students design and carry out experiments

------------------------------------------------------------------------
In practice almost complete overlap all supervised by me.
 * too many for individual projects
 * work in pairs, subtasks of a big task
 * some linguistic analysis, some programming, some teamwork

When to meet?  Where to meet?


Some ideas I have:

### WSD of parallel text
 * one shot with different contexts
 * find and compare translations
 ** use them as context to LLM
 ** use them for intersection
 * rank salience using LLM
 * make new entries (hard)
 * interface to read?  experiment on UI? *Not my expertise*
 * look at sentiment
 * some hand work at end
 
 * get the version mapping done

 * Do translations of 蜘蛛の糸 and work with them

 * sentiment and time over the stories


### Finding lexical metaphors in different languages
 * use wordnet
 * use wiktionary
 ** find hypernym from definition
 ** look at senses with different hypernyms (use PERSON/ANIMAL but make it programmable)
 * focus on a language or focus on multilingual?
 * look at positive negative?
 * look at borrowing?

 * maybe also look at morpholical links
 * also at lexical-conceptual mapping

### Expand Czech Wordnet
 * systematic improvements
   * eg add adverbs
 * mine wiktionary
 * use LLMs but human in the loop
 * use new links aspect/gender/diminuative
 * some derivational links? -ák 
 * get the UD annotation working
 * taboo mapping
 
 * revamp synset-align
 
### Abui
 * first pass POS
 * spiral annotation with fixing POS tagger
 * link to wordnet
 * could be subtask of WSD
